Description: # FEATS
        
        ## Description
        
        FEATS is a new Python tool for performing the following downstream analysis on single-cell RNA-seq datasets:
        
        1. Clustering
        2. Estimating the number of clusters
        3. Outlier detection
        4. Batch correction and integration of data from multiple experiments
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        FEATS depends on the following packages
        
        1. numpy
        2. pandas
        3. scikit-learn
        4. scipy
        5. [singlecelldata](https://edwinv87.github.io/singlecelldata/)
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install FEATS run the following command:
        
        `pip install feats`
        
        ## Documentation
        
        The functional reference manual for FEATS is available [here](https://feats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
        
        ### Examples
        
        To use FEATS, please refer to the following example code presented in notebook sytle environment.
        
        1. [Clustering using FEATS](https://edwinv87.github.io/feats/docs/FEATS-Clustering.html)
        2. [Performing outlier analysis](https://edwinv87.github.io/feats/docs/FEATS-Outlier-Detection.html)
        3. [Performing batch correction](https://edwinv87.github.io/feats/docs/FEATS-Batch-Correction.html)
        
        ### Data
        
        The data for the examples in this section is available [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!At-SAxmefBX_gr47oWbiMS8vSSKWRA?e=F4FUrt). The data is contained in subfolders in the datasets folder. The subfolders are named according to the dataset name. To load the data for the examples above, provide the path to the datasets folder.
